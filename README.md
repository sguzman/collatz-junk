# Collatz Junk
All my tiny Mathematica scripts that I use to study collatz conjecture

### Some lines of attack I want to explore
Some of these I have tried and others I have not. Beware that some of these are more general
than complete lines of attack. Some of these elements just represent formal methods which
might or might not yield something later.

- Reduce to function composition
- Representing the indeterminancy of choosing between even or odd with a real analytic version of `if`
- Graph theory
- Number theory
- Formal Grammar
- Markov Chains
